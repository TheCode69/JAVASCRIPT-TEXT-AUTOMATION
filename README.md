#JAVASCRIPT-TEXT-AUTOMATION   
In this code, the JavaScript function displayMessage is responsible for typing out the message character by character.

The setTimeout function is used to control the typing speed. 
You can adjust the typing speed by changing the second argument of setTimeout (currently set to 100 milliseconds).

Make sure to link the JavaScript file (script.js) in your HTML file to enable the typing effect. 
When you open the HTML file in a web browser, the message will be displayed as if it's being typed on the webpage.
